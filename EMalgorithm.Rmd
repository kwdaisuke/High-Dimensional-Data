## The GMM and the EM algorithm

The EM algorithm is implemented for R in the 'mclust'

```{r}
#install.packages("mclust")
library(mclust)
```

The help of the package is available:

```{r}
?Mclust
```

```{r}
data(swiss)
out=Mclust(swiss, G= 3)
plot(swiss, col=out$classification)
```
> GMM model seems working better on large and small clusters
> Exercise: have a look at what is inside 'out' and to relate it with the GMM.

```{r}
out$parameters
```

> Exercise: Compare the GMM clustering with the ones obtained with kmeans and hclust

## K-means
```{r}
out5 = kmeans(swiss, centers=3, nstart=10)
plot(swiss, col=out5$cluster, pch=19)
```

## Hierarchical Clustering
```{r}

library(class)
?hclust
D = dist(swiss)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hc1 = hclust(D, method="complete"); plot(hc1)
hc2 = hclust(D, method="single"); plot(hc2)
hc3 = hclust(D, method="centroid"); plot(hc3)
hc4 = hclust(D, method="ward.D2");plot(hc4)
```
